Creating a Custom Classes in Python
=>The Challenge is creating Rectangle Class with the Instance

The Requirements are:

An instance of the Rectangle class requires length:int and width:int to be initialized.
We can iterate over an instance of the Rectangle class
When an instance of the Rectangle class is iterated over, we first get its length in the format: {'length': <VALUE_OF_LENGTH>} followed by the width {'width': <VALUE_OF_WIDTH>}
After complition of project we go with URL:"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rectangle/{give the value of lenght}/{give the value of width}/" like this.

=>For Example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/rectangle/27/100/
We get the output like this: =>{'length': 27}{'width': 100}

Thankyou!!!!!
